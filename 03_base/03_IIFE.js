//IIFE- Immideatly invoked function expression
/*Immediate Execution: IIFE functions are executed right away, ensuring that the code within them runs without the need for a
separate function call.
Encapsulation: IIFE creates a private scope for variables, preventing them from polluting the global scope and avoiding
conflicts with other parts of your code.
Anonymous or Named: You can define IIFE as an anonymous function (without a name) or a named function (with a name).
Anonymous IIFE is more common, but named IIFE can be helpful for debugging. */
